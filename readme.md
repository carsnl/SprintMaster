## About <a name="about">
Sprint Master is a digital task organising tool for Agile teams to keep track of a projectâ€™s progress by displaying ongoing tasks as a collection of compact, information-rich cards which presents essential information at a glance. Task details are safely stored in these cards and may be quickly modified as the project evolves without the hassle of traditional documentation or processes such as keeping paperwork up to date. 

#### Feautres:
- Keep a record of the project team and all its participating members.
- Create customisable task cards, with each card including details such as a name, description, story points, priority, status, asignee and tags.
- Modify or delete task cards as the project progresses or requirements change.
